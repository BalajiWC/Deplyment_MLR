Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to predict a dependent variable (Y) based on multiple independent variables (X1, X2, X3, ... Xn).

It is an extension of simple linear regression, where instead of using just one predictor, we use multiple predictors to make better predictions.

Where:

Y = Dependent Variable (Target we want to predict)

b₀ = Intercept (the value of Y when all Xs are 0)

b₁, b₂, b₃, ..., bₙ = Regression Coefficients (weights that determine the impact of each independent variable)

X₁, X₂, X₃, ..., Xₙ = Independent Variables (features/predictors)

ε = Error term (accounts for unexplained variations)
